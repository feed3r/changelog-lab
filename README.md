# changelog-lab

**Note: This is a temporary, experimental repository.**

This repository is created solely for experimenting with automatic changelog generation tools, specifically the [Tag Changelog GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/tag-changelog).

It contains fake commits, tags, and other artifacts, but **no meaningful code or real project content**.  
All files, commits, and tags are for demonstration and testing purposes only.

The repository may be deleted or archived once the experiments are complete.
